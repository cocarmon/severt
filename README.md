# 📊 Metrics and 🎯 Goals for an HTTP Server Project

## 1. 🚀 Performance Metrics

- [x] **Throughput**: Measure how many requests your server can handle per second.
- [x] **Latency**: Measure response times (average and p99 latency) under varying loads.
- [x] **Concurrency**: Test how the server performs with 10, 100, or 1,000 concurrent connections.
- [x] **CPU/Memory Usage**: Profile the server under load to ensure efficient resource usage.

## 2. 🛠️ Features and Extensibility

- [x] **Static File Serving**:
  - Serve files efficiently with support for partial requests (HTTP Range headers).
- [x] **Logging Support**:
  - Allow users to keep track of errors through logging.
- [x] **Customizable Error Handling**:
  - Add meaningful HTTP error codes and allow users to define error pages.

## 3. 📚 HTTP Compliance

- [x] **HTTP 1.1 Support**:
  - Include persistent connections with keep-alive headers.
- [x] **Standards Adherence**:
  - Properly handle request/response headers, content encoding, and status codes.
- [x] **Content Negotiation**:
  - Respond based on `Accept` headers (e.g., Image or HTML).

## 4. 📈 Scalability and Concurrency

- [x] **Asynchronous I/O**:
- [ ] **Thread Pooling**:
- [x] **Load Testing**:

## 5. 🔧 Advanced Features

- [x] **Caching**:
  - Implement in-memory caching for frequently requested resources.
  - Support `ETag` or `Last-Modified` headers.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**:
  - Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP.
- [x] **Logging**:
  - Log requests and generate usage analytics (e.g., popular endpoints, error rates).

## 🎯 Advanced Goals

1. **Set Performance Targets**:
   - Handle 3k RPS (requests per second) with less than a 1% error rate.
2. **Compliance**:
   - Pass an HTTP compliance suite like `h2spec`.
